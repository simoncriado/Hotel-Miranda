# Hotel Miranda

Hotel Miranda is the main project part of the training at OXYGEN Academy. It is the landing page for a fictional hotel. In this repository you will only find the landing page of the hotel, but in another repository (I will copy the link here) you will find the admin dashboard. There I will implement the data flow: creating rooms, editing the prices, entering bookings and adapt the availability of the rooms accordingly, manage incoming user messages, etc. Then both landing page and admin dashboard will be connected so that they can interact with each other.

## Tech used

HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM & JavaScript.
